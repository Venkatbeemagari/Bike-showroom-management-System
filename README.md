# Bike-showroom-management-System


The project in question is a simple bike showroom management system implemented in Python using object-oriented programming concepts. The system consists of two classes - Bike and Showroom.

The Bike class represents a bike with attributes such as model, year, and price. It has an __init__ method that initializes these attributes and a display method that prints the bike's details to the console.

The Showroom class represents a bike showroom and has an inventory of bikes. It has an __init__ method that initializes the showroom name and an empty inventory list. The class has methods to add a bike to the inventory, display the inventory, and search for a bike by its model.

The main program creates three Bike objects and a Showroom object. The three bikes are then added to the showroom's inventory using the add_bike method. The display_inventory method is called to display all the bikes in the showroom's inventory. Finally, the search_bike method is called to search for a bike by its model.

Overall, this project demonstrates the basics of object-oriented programming in Python and how to implement a simple management system using classes and objects.
